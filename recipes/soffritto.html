<h1>Clancy's Soffritto</h1>
<img src="soffritto.jpeg" alt="cooked soffritto">
<h2>A hearty, nutritious base for Italian dishes</h2>
<p>When making anything from pasta to pizza, lasagne, caponata or just about anything else, a soffritto is necessary as a base. Just add the ingredients, ie sardines and casarrecce pasta, to the soffritto in order to make a delicious meal.</p>
<p>The best thing about this dish is that it has nearly everything the human body needs. A very healthy supply of vegetables and antioxidents mean that you simply need to add protein and carbs and you're good to go!</p>
<p>The amounts within the ingredients list are a rough guide. The only important thing to remember is to have roughly double the amount of onion as carrots or celery, ie 2 part onions, 1 part carrot, 1 part celery.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 large onions</li>
    <li>2 large carrots</li>
    <li>half a bunch of celery</li>
    <li>1 head of garlic</li>
    <li>3 tins (or roughly 1-1.5kg) diced tomato</li>
    <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil (I like Cobram Estate robust)</li>
    <li>Your choice of oregano, parsley and basil for flavour.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to cook:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Dice the onions nice and fine. Place them in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Dice the carrots and celery evenly and place in separate bowls.</li>
    <li>Peel and dice the garlic.</li>
    <li>Heat a large non-stick frying pan to medium.</li>
    <li>Put the olive oil in the (now hot) frying pan and add the onions. Be sure to turn them as they cook.</li>
    <li>Once the onions cook to translucency, add the carrots. Once the carrots begin to soften, add the celery.</li>
    <li>With the base of the soffritto now fully cooked, add the garlic and cook for only 30sec to 1min.</li>
    <li>Add the diced tomato and stir!</li>
    <li>The soffritto takes about an hour to slow cook. Feel free to add aromatic herbs and salt to your own taste. Be sure to go easy on the salt as more salt will be added later when you utilise the soffritto.</li>
    <li>When beautifully slow cooked, relocate any soffritto that you won't be using tonight in airtight containers and store safe and sound in the fridge.</li>
    <li>Bon appetite!</li>
