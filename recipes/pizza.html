<h1>Homemade Pizza</h1>

<h2>The perfect homemade pizza for cozy nights in</h2>
<p>In the last recipe I said that pasta has a bad rep. That goes doubly so for pizza! Most people, when they think of pizza, think of the worst most overprocessed food. It doesn't need to be this way!</p>
<p>Pizza was the first recipe I really learnt. I learnt it to impress my wife (then fianc√©). It's since become a lynchpin weekend meal.</p>
<p>Try not to think of pizza as something inherently unhealthy. Think of it as a pasta sandwich, ie instead of a healthy dry pasta, you're using flour and yeast to make bread. Once easily mastered it becomes a very rewarding process!</p>
<h2>Ingredients (serves two):</h2>
<ul>
    <li>200g "Clancy's Soffritto"</li>
    <li>150g typo 00 semolina flour</li>
    <li>100ml water</li>
    <li>1 tsp dry yeast (or your sourdough equivalent if applicable)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp raw sugar (don't worry, the yeast will eat it up)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    <li>125g Anchovies (yes, it's an acquired taste)</li>
    <li>50g "Mutti" tomato puree (passatta)</li>
    <li>Mozarella cheese to sprinkle</li>
    <li>Aromatic herbs to season</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to cook:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the yeast mixture by mixing the water, yeast and sugar in a small measuring jug. Give this 10 minutes before proceeding.</li>
    <li>Make the dry pizza dough by mixing the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the olive oil to the yeast mixture and add directly to the dry pizza dough. Mix this by cutting it with a butter knife.</li>
    <li>On a lightly floured countertop, knead out the dough. This doesn't take too long, only about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Put the pizza dough back in the mixing bowl, lightly drizzled with olive oil, and cover with a moist tea towel. Leave this to rise for 1.5 hours.</li>
    <li>After an hour, preheat the over to 220c celcius. On my oven this takes about 20-30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once the dough has risen, make it onto a pizza! You can toss it, roll it, stretch it; however you prefer!</li>
    <li>Put the pizza dough onto a pizza stone or round, oven proof pan. I use a <em>La Creusset</em> enamel pan.</li>
    <li>Put the passatta onto the pizza dough. Spread it with a tablespoon.</li>
    <li>Put the "Clancy's Soffritto" onto the passatta. Don't push down too hard or it'll go everywhere!</li>
    <li>Put the anchovies onto the soffritto, spaced out evenly.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the mozarella onto the pizza. I do this with my hands; it's easier to rip it than grate it.</li>
    <li>Season the pizza with aromatic herbs.</li>
    <li>Put the pizza in the oven. Turn the heat down to 200 celcius. Let it bake until the cheese melts and browns.</li>
    <li>Serve up!</li>
