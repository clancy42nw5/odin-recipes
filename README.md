Building HTML recipe website ala ODIN
This project is based on an ODIN exercise. In the exercise I will be creating a website containing a recipe for my beloved SOFFRITTO.
Completing this exercise will demonstrate my ability to code a fully formed webpage using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).
Later I will revisit this and use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to give it a nicer design.
